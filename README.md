# Starkey Martial Arts - Milestone Project 1

 This is my first webpage and also my first project for ther course. Unfortunately the project wasn't given the time needed so it's not as complete as I would have liked.

## Technologies Used For This Site

For this project I used HTML5 and CSS3.

The code was written using [Code Anywhere](<https://app.codeanywhere.com>) and [Git Hub](<https://github.com/>).

For the wire frames in this file I used Balsamiq.

## Description

This site was built for the martial arts club where I train. They relied on social media to share information so I sugeested a website where people can have an interactive experience while gathering all the information needed about the club.

All of the information you need for classes and times in 1 place.

In future I would like to add a coaches section, a logo to the header and anchors to the classes and coaches in the timetable element.

I've tried to make it as simple as possible and keep it within the colour schemes of the club.

There are bits missing which i would like to add at a later date. For example, the club logo on the header was something that was left out becuase of the poor design of it on Canva.

This was the original idea which I'd put together in Balsamiq.

Tested code and got no errors. i did get an info message saying Trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values.

To resolve the issue I removed the trailing slash where appropriate.

Copied the newly tested code to contact and timetable pages now there are no errors or info messages.

Checked nav element works on all pages correctly.

Added sections from line 33 to 77 and tested code. No errors to report.

Adeded line 78 to 115 and tested code. No errors to report.

Added footer section. Line 116 to 131. Tested code. No errors to report.

Added the h2 section to the timetable page. lines 49 to 57. Tested code and found no errors.

Added class timetable h2 section to lines 58 to 60. Tested code. No errors found.

Deleted the id's and classes from all timetable.html sections.

Added timetable section to timetable.html from line 62 to 294 and tested code. found 1 error 'Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections, or else use a div element instead for any cases where no heading is needed'. I will add a h2 and see what happens.

Added a h2 element inside the timetable section on line 63. Tested code. No errors found. 

Deleted h2 from line 58 to 60 in timetable.html as it was meant to be inside the section.
