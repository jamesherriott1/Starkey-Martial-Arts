# Starkey Martial Arts - Milestone Project 1

 This is my first webpage and also my first project for ther course. Unfortunately the project wasn't given the time needed so it's not as complete as I would have liked. 

## Technologies Used For This Site

For this project I used HTML5 and CSS3. 

The code was written using [Code Anywhere](<https://app.codeanywhere.com>) and [Git Hub](<https://github.com/>).

For the wire frames in this file I used Balsamiq.

## Description

This site was built for the martial arts club where I train. They relied on social media to share information so I sugeested a website where people can have an interactive experience while gathering all the information needed about the club.

I've tried to make it as simple as possible and keep it within the colour schemes of the club.

There are bits missing which i would like to add at a later date. For example, the club logo on the header was something that was left out becuase of the poor design of it on Canva.
