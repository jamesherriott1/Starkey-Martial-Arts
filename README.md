# Starkey Martial Arts - Milestone Project 1

 This is my first webpage and also my first project for ther course. Unfortunately the project wasn't given the time needed so it's not as complete as I would have liked. 

## Technologies Used For This Site

For this project I used HTML5 and CSS3. 

The code was written using [Code Anywhere](<https://app.codeanywhere.com>) and [Git Hub](<https://github.com/>).

For the wire frames in this file I used Balsamiq.
