# Starkey Martial Arts - Milestone Project 1

 This is my first webpage and also my first project for ther course. Unfortunately the project wasn't given the time needed so it's not as complete as I would have liked.

## Technologies Used For This Site

For this project I used HTML5 and CSS3.

The code was written using [Code Anywhere](<https://app.codeanywhere.com>) and [Git Hub](<https://github.com/>).

For the wire frames in this file I used Balsamiq.

## Description

This site was built for the martial arts club where I train. They relied on social media to share information so I sugeested a website where people can have an interactive experience while gathering all the information needed about the club.

I've tried to make it as simple as possible and keep it within the colour schemes of the club.

There are bits missing which i would like to add at a later date. For example, the club logo on the header was something that was left out becuase of the poor design of it on Canva.

This was the original idea which I'd put together in Balsamiq.

This is how it looks now.

## Bugs And Fixes

I came a cross quite a few issues, most of which were resolved by going back through the Code Institute tutorials to refresh my memory.

Issues where I needed external help are listed below.

### TimeTable HTML and CSS

I struggled with making the table, even after going over the Code Institute videos, so I did a Google search to gain some more knowledge.
I used some HTML and CSS from [101 Computing] (<https://www.101computing.net/my-timetable-in-html-css/>) for the basic structure of my timetable and added or removed code as neccessary.

### HTML Submit Button Outside The Form

There were some styling issues with the submit button being inside my form element so I Googled how to put it outside and styled it.
I got the code from [Dev Diaries](https://www.dev-diaries.com/social-posts/html-submit-button-outside-form/#:~:text=For%20a%20HTML%20form%20element,with%20the%20button's%20form%20property.)

### Background Image

I had issues getting the background image to work so I styled it in HTML instead of CSS
